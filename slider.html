        <h2>Cuttlefish</h2>
        <p>The cuttlefish is a clever, soft-bodied marine animal known for its remarkable ability to change color and texture in an
        instant. Using specialized skin cells, it can blend seamlessly into its surroundings or create dazzling displays to
        communicate. Despite its name, the cuttlefish is not a fish but a cephalopod, related to squids and octopuses.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Dumbo Octopus</h2>
        <p>The dumbo octopus is a deep-sea cephalopod named for its ear-like fins that resemble the ears of Disney’s Dumbo. Living
        thousands of meters below the ocean’s surface, it glides gracefully through the water with gentle fin flaps. This small,
        soft-bodied creature is known for its calm demeanor and adorable, almost cartoon-like appearance.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Lungfish</h2>
        <p>The lungfish is a unique freshwater fish known for its ability to breathe air using lung-like organs. During dry
        seasons, it can burrow into mud and enter a dormant state to survive when water is scarce. With its long, eel-like body
        and remarkable resilience, the lungfish bridges the evolutionary gap between aquatic and land-dwelling animals.</p>
