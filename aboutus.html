        <h1>All about sea life!</h1>
        <p>Sea life thrives in a vast, shimmering world beneath the waves, where colorful fish dart through coral forests andgentle giants like whales glide through open waters. From tiny plankton drifting with the currents to clever octopuses hiding among rocks, each creature plays a unique role in the ocean’s delicate balance. This underwater realm is full of mystery, beauty, and surprising wonders waiting to be discovered.
</p>
<p>The ocean is home to a wide variety of sea life, each adapted to its own part of the marine world. Fish of all shapes
and sizes swim through reefs and open waters, while mammals like dolphins and whales roam the deep. Crustaceans such as
crabs and shrimp scuttle along the seafloor, and mollusks like clams, octopuses, and squid thrive in diverse habitats.
Even tiny organisms like plankton play a crucial role, forming the foundation of the ocean’s food chain.
